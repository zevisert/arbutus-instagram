# \<arbutus-viewer\>

A polymer-based webcomponent I'm releasing independently from my upcoming 'arbutus' project. This webcomponent is for loading image and video content asynchronously (lazily) and within shadow dom.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve the element locally.

## Viewing the Element

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

The application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run my application's test suite locally.
